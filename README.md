Being eco-friendly helps cloud-dedicated servers meet green 
computing requirements. Task scheduling is one of the major concerns in 
cloud-based solutions that must be taken into account for improving system 
effectiveness and the user experience. The phrase "green cloud computing" 
describes how to effectively employ information technology and other 
technical breakthroughs for the environment's benefit. The prime goal of this 
paper is to find an algorithm that focuses mostly on decreasing execution 
times of green cloud computing and is efficient for the environment. We 
compared some task scheduling algorithms contingent on the execution time, 
like FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin, with the algorithm we advised, the 
generalized priority (GP) algorithm. Using the CloudSim 3.0.3 simulator, we 
performed an experiment to validate our approach. The algorithm we 
suggested has the shortest runtime out of all the algorithms which is 97.91.
